## Advanced Review Techniques

### 1. **The Progressive Review Approach**
Match review depth to change impact:

**🟢 Low Impact (Cosmetic, Docs, Tests)**
- Quick scan for obvious issues
- 1 reviewer, lightweight process
- Focus on consistency and completeness

**🟡 Medium Impact (Feature Changes, Refactoring)**
- Detailed functional review
- 2 reviewers including domain expert
- Testing and integration focus

**🔴 High Impact (API Changes, Critical Path, Security)**
- Comprehensive architectural review
- 3+ reviewers including senior maintainers
- Security review, performance benchmarks

### 2. **Expert Questioning Techniques**

**Instead of commands, use collaborative questions:**

❌ "Fix this performance issue"
✅ "I'm wondering if we could optimize this by caching the result? What do you think about the memory trade-off?"

❌ "This is wrong"
✅ "Help me understand the reasoning here. I'm seeing X, but I would expect Y because of Z."

❌ "Add error handling"
✅ "What happens if the network request fails here? Should we retry or fail gracefully?"

### 3. **The Five-Level Comment Framework**

**Level 1 - Blocker**: Must fix before merge
```
🚨 **BLOCKER**: This creates a race condition that could corrupt user data.
**Impact**: Data loss in production
**Required Action**: Add proper synchronization
```

**Level 2 - Critical**: Should fix before merge
```

```

**Level 3 - Important**: Should consider fixing
```
⚡ **IMPORTANT**: Performance concern
**Impact**: Could be slow with large datasets
**Alternative**: Consider using a Set for O(1) lookup
```

**Level 4 - Suggestion**: Nice to have
```
💡 **SUGGESTION**: Could improve readability
**Benefit**: Easier maintenance
**Idea**: What about extracting this to a helper function?
```

**Level 5 - Nitpick**: Optional improvement
```

## Advanced Comment Patterns

### **The Teaching Moment Pattern**
```
🎓 **Learning Opportunity**: This is a great place to discuss error handling patterns.

**Current approach**: Direct error throwing
**Alternative**: Result<T, Error> pattern used elsewhere in the codebase
**Benefits**: More explicit error handling, better composability
**Example**: See how `UserService::authenticate()` handles this

**What do you think?** Would this pattern work better here, or are there constraints I'm missing?
```

### **The Architecture Guidance Pattern**
```
🏗️ **Architecture**: I notice this introduces a new dependency between modules.

**Observation**: `PaymentService` now depends on `NotificationService`
**Concern**: Creates circular dependency with existing notification → payment flow
**Impact**: Makes testing harder, reduces modularity

**Suggested approach**: Consider using events/pub-sub pattern
**Example**: `EventBus.emit('payment_completed', {orderId, amount})`
**Benefits**: Decoupled modules, easier testing, more scalable

**Reference**: Similar pattern in `OrderService::complete()` at line 234
```

### **The Collaborative Problem-Solving Pattern**
```
🤝 **Let's solve this together**: I see what you're trying to achieve, but I'm concerned about the approach.

**Goal**: Optimize database queries for user dashboard
**Current solution**: Eager loading all user relationships
**My concern**: Could cause memory issues with power users (1000+ items)

**Ideas to explore**:
1. Pagination with cursor-based approach
2. Lazy loading with caching
3. GraphQL-style field selection
4. Background job for heavy computation

**What are your thoughts?** Have you considered the memory constraints? Are there other requirements I should know about?

**Happy to pair on this** if you'd like to explore options together.
```

## Expertise Development Through Reviews

### **Mentoring Junior Developers**
```
🌱 **For consideration**: This is a common pattern that I've seen trip up developers.

**What you've done**: Direct DOM manipulation in React
**Why it works**: Updates the UI as expected
**Potential issue**: React doesn't know about the change, could cause conflicts

**Learning moment**: React prefers declarative updates through state
**Better approach**: Use useState hook and let React manage the DOM
**Why this matters**: Prevents bugs with concurrent updates, easier to test

**Example refactor**:
// Instead of: document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = 'Success'
// Try: setStatus('Success') with <div>{status}</div>

**No rush on this** - it works as-is, but this pattern will help as the app grows.
**Questions?** Happy to explain more about React's reconciliation if helpful!
```

### **Elevating Experienced Developers**
```
🚀 **Advanced discussion**: Your solution works well. Want to explore some edge cases?

**Current implementation**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
**Solid choice**: Handles network failures gracefully
**Edge case to consider**: What happens with systematic failures (bad deploy)?

**Advanced patterns to explore**:
- Circuit breaker pattern for cascading failures
- Jittered backoff to prevent thundering herd
- Dead letter queue for unrecoverable errors
- Metrics/alerting for retry patterns

**References**:
- Microservices.io circuit breaker pattern
- AWS Well-Architected reliability pillar
- Similar implementation in `OrderService` for inspiration

**Thought experiment**: How would this behave under load with 1000 concurrent failures?
```

## Implementation Guide

### **Setting Review Standards**

**1. Define Your Project's Risk Profile**
- Critical: Financial, security, infrastructure
- Important: User-facing features, APIs
- Standard: Internal tools, documentation
- Low-risk: Cosmetic changes, experiments

**2. Establish Review Requirements**
```yaml
critical:
  reviewers_required: 3
  must_include: [security_team, senior_engineer, domain_expert]
  gates: [security_scan, performance_test, documentation_update]

important:
  reviewers_required: 2
  must_include: [domain_expert]
  gates: [automated_tests, integration_tests]

standard:
  reviewers_required: 1
  gates: [automated_tests, lint_checks]
```

**3. Create Review Templates**
```markdown
## Security Review (for critical changes)

```

## Advanced Scenarios

### **Handling Disagreements**
```
🤝 **Different perspectives**: I see we have different views on this approach.

**Your position**: Microservice architecture for this feature
**My position**: Monolithic approach initially

**Your valid points**: Better scalability, clear boundaries
**My concerns**: Added complexity, network overhead, debugging difficulty

**Data we need**: Expected scale, team size, deployment complexity
**Compromise idea**: Modular monolith with clear interfaces, microservices later

**Next steps**: Could we document both approaches and get input from [architect/team lead]?
**Timeline consideration**: What's the urgency? Does this affect the decision?
```

### **Large PR Review Strategy**
```
📦 **Large PR Strategy**: This is a substantial change (500+ lines). Here's my approach:

**High-level review first**:
1. Architecture and design patterns ✅
2. Security implications ✅  
3. Performance impact ✅
4. Testing strategy ✅

**Detailed review by component**:
- Authentication changes: Looks good, one question about session handling
- Database migration: Please add rollback procedure
- API updates: Consider versioning for breaking changes
- Frontend integration: UX flow looks solid

**Suggestion for future**: Consider breaking large features into smaller PRs
**Benefits**: Easier review, faster feedback cycles, reduced merge conflicts
**Pattern**: Feature flags + incremental rollout works well for this type of change
```
