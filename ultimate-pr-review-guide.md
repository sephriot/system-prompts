## Domain-Specific Review Excellence

### Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Compose)
**What Makes Reviews Exceptional:**
- **Concurrency Focus**: "Can you add an assertion that we are in the idle state after this? Or does it make sense to avoid the sleep altogether and instead use WaitForStateChange?"
- **Resource Management**: Deep scrutiny of memory leaks, deadlocks, and resource cleanup
- **Backward Compatibility**: Rigorous validation of API changes and migration paths
- **Distributed Systems Thinking**: Reviews consider network partitions, consensus, and failure modes

**Critical Failure Modes:**
- Race conditions in state management
- Deadlocks in gRPC connections
- Resource leaks in long-running processes
- Breaking changes in APIs without proper deprecation

**Review Patterns:**
```
// Excellence Pattern: Proactive Testing Suggestions
"Without the fix, won't this hang forever like we observed in the reported issue? 
Can we do something smarter here to make sure this test exits quickly even in 
the face of the deadlock?"
```

## Review Rigor Scaling Framework

### Change Impact Assessment Matrix

| Impact Level | Review Requirements | Examples |
|-------------|--------------------|---------| 
| **Critical** | 3+ senior reviewers, security review, performance benchmarks | API changes, security fixes, core algorithm changes |
| **High** | 2+ reviewers, comprehensive testing, documentation updates | New features, refactoring, dependency updates |
| **Medium** | 1+ reviewer, standard testing, focused review | Bug fixes, minor improvements, test additions |
| **Low** | Automated approval for trusted contributors | Documentation updates, typo fixes, formatting |

### Domain-Specific Scaling

**Kubernetes**: Scale review rigor based on:
- Component criticality (API server > controller > client)
- User impact (breaking changes require extensive review)
- Security implications (RBAC changes need security review)

**PyTorch**: Scale based on:
- Performance impact on training workloads
- API surface changes (backward compatibility)
- Hardware-specific code paths

**Redis**: Scale based on:
- Memory allocation patterns
- Core data structure modifications
- Thread safety implications

## Expert Review Techniques

### Advanced Questioning Patterns

#### 1. **Hypothesis-Driven Questions**
```
"I'm wondering if this approach handles the edge case where...?"
"Have you considered what happens when...?"
"Could this lead to issues in scenarios where...?"
```

#### 2. **Alternative Exploration**
```
"What other approaches did you consider?"
"Could we achieve this with a simpler approach?"
"Is there a way to make this more testable?"
```

#### 3. **Future-Proofing Questions**
```
"How will this scale when we have 10x more data?"
"What happens when we need to extend this functionality?"
"Are we making any assumptions that might not hold long-term?"
```

### Mentoring Through Reviews

#### Progressive Guidance Pattern
```
1. "This works, but consider..."
2. "Here's why this approach might be better..."
3. "In similar situations, I've found that..."
4. "Let me know if you'd like to discuss this approach further"
```

#### Educational Commentary
```
"// This is a great use of the builder pattern here because..."
"// Note: We avoid X pattern in this codebase because..."
"// Pro tip: This optimization technique is particularly effective for..."
```

## Advanced Comment Patterns

### The "Collaborative Improvement" Pattern
```
✅ GOOD: "What do you think about extracting this logic into a helper method? 
It might make the main function easier to follow."

❌ AVOID: "Extract this into a helper method."
```

### The "Context-Rich Suggestion" Pattern
```
✅ GOOD: "In our codebase, we typically handle timeouts by... because it provides 
better error reporting to users. Would this approach work here?"

❌ AVOID: "Handle timeouts differently."
```

### The "Performance-Aware" Pattern
```
✅ GOOD: "This looks correct, but I'm wondering about the performance implications 
when we're processing large datasets. Have you done any benchmarking?"

❌ AVOID: "This might be slow."
```

### The "Security-Conscious" Pattern
```
✅ GOOD: "I notice we're handling user input here. Should we validate/sanitize 
this before processing to prevent XYZ attack?"

❌ AVOID: "This is insecure."
```
