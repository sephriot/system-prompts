# Pull Request Workflow

## üìå Initial Setup
**Branch Management**: If currently on `main` or `master`, create and switch to a new feature branch before making any commits.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Pre-Commit Checks**
   - Review unstaged changes
   - Stage and commit with meaningful messages following Git commit conventions
   - **Critical**: Never commit directly to `main` branch

### 2. **Draft PR Creation**
   - Use repository's PR template (typically `.github/pull_request_template.md`)
   - Create as draft initially for review and refinement

### 3. **Template Completion**
   - Fill every section completely
   - Maintain original template structure
   - Ensure all required fields are addressed

### 4. **Content Quality**
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive, and action-oriented
   - **Description**: Technical yet accessible, focused on the "why" and "what"
   - **Checkboxes**: Mark appropriately to reflect actual PR status

### 5. **Review Process**
   - Assign appropriate reviewers
   - Conduct self-review following established guidelines
   - Address any immediate concerns or gaps

### 6. **Finalization**
   - Convert from draft to "ready for review" only after thorough self-assessment
   - Ensure all automation checks pass
   - Shedule automatic squash merge once all checks pass if the repository is using merge queue.

## üìù Description Best Practices

**Structure your PR description to include:**

- **Purpose**: Why this change is needed (business/technical rationale)
- **Approach**: High-level overview of the solution
- **Impact**: What changes for users, developers, or systems
- **Testing**: How the changes were validated
- **Dependencies**: Any related PRs, issues, or external changes

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Lead with the problem being solved
- Use present tense for descriptions
- Be specific about technical changes without overwhelming detail
- Avoid file listings (GitHub's diff view handles this)
- Include relevant context for reviewers
