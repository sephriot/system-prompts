## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Branch selection**
   If the current branch name is `main` or `master`, checkout to new one before commiting changes.

2. **Check for Unstaged Changes**  
   If present, stage and commit with a meaningful summary (ask for input if needed), following instructions in `Git commit instructions` section.
   Never create new commits on `main` branch. Always switch to new branch if on `main` before commiting changes.

3. **Create Draft PR**  
   Use the repository‚Äôs PR template (usually in `.github/pull_request_template.md`).

4. **Complete the Template**  
   Fill in *every section*. Do not delete or alter structure.

5. **Ensure Description Matches Template**  
   All content from the template must be present in the PR body.

6. **Title & Description**  
   Write a clear, descriptive title. Keep the description technical but concise.

7. **Checkboxes**  
   Mark relevant checkboxes to reflect PR status accurately.

8. **Reviewers**  
   Assign reviewers if needed.

9. **Review**
   Review Pull request following pull request review instruction.

10. **Convert to ready for review**
   If the review results are positive (i.e. PR looks good, no major concerns are identified), convert the PR from draft to ready for review.
